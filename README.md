### Motivation ###
As people try to get into new businesses to increase their income after a hard year, we
found that there is no way to predict how much someone should charge for an Airbnb listing. To
make that transition easier we want to create a model that can predict the price of the market for
a new place taking into account its characteristics. This model then could be used to create web
applications or mobile apps and help people to get into the Airbnb business.

### Data ###

time cleaning it. The data consists of 16 columns and 6523 rows.

latitude,longitude, room_type, price,minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, last_review,
